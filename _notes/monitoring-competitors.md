For any company, keeping track of your position in the competitive landscape is a key element of making the right decisions.
__How much__ time and attention should you spend on monitoring and analyzing your competitive position? Clearly the right answer lies somewhere on the spectrum between **none** and **way too much**.

It seems commonplace to skew too far to the left or right on this spectrum — to either be too concerned with the day-to-day movement of what your competitors are doing, or to have too much confidence in your own position, willfully ignoring what your competitors or the market are doing.

Clearly the right answer is somewhere in the center, taking qualities or behaviors from each leaning and combining them in creative ways to do something unique, but with enough similarity to the market that you can sell the future you're building with minimal friction.

What if we could think about "competitive attention" on a spectrum? The spectrum could go from:

* Zero attention on competitors or the market, to
* Spending all of your time worried about and analyzing what competitors are doing

Broadly speaking, moving along each direction of the spectrum trends toward being more of a **leader** or a **follower**. Leaders blaze their own path and drive toward a vision of the future they define. Followers can't stop chasing what someone else is doing.

World-changing product leaders don't completely ignore what markets look like of course, but they tend to view the world from a **__demand__** perspective (What do customers want? What are the [[Jobs to be done]]) rather than a **__supply__** one (Who is building what in the market?)

Let's define a spectrum, and some points along it:

Definitions on the spectrum — the left side leans toward creative independence, the right toward paranoid imitation:

### Independent mindset

* ⟽ **Willful Ignorance** — You're irrationally overconfident in your market position. You intentionally don't care what competitors are doing, you denigrate other options or solutions as irrelevant or obsolete, and you believe you're more important to your customer than you are.
* ⟻ **Blissful Naiveté** — You don't go so far as to think you're invincible, but your ignorance of the market is due to naiveté more than confidence. You don't bother to spend the time to understand the landscape you participate in.
* ⭐️ **Creative Confidence** — The ideal place to be. Confident in your own ideas, maintaining the ability to design and build solutions independently of what others in the market are doing. You focus on creating from first principles based on customer demand, not on copying what others do.

### Paranoid mindset

* ⟾ **Dangerous Obsession** —  You let competitors dominate your thinking, constantly worried that every new one you discover is already eating your lunch. You call meetings and have big discussions about what competitors are doing, in the worst cases moving your own goalposts continuously when competitors make movements. Instead of worrying about how to solve your current customers' problems and inventing new solutions for them, you're spend all your time looking for a customer you don't have. [[The grass is always greener]] somewhere else. 
* ⟼ **Frequent Distraction** — You do spend time with your own customers looking at what you can build for them, but you let what other people are doing or building distract you from the time required to build truly novel product. Monitoring others' feature lists and building comparison matrices steals away enough attention to slow you down in your new creative efforts. Keeping up with what's in the rearview steals away your attention from solving your __current__ customer's problems.
* ⭐️ **Informed Balance** — You're knowledgable about the market and its players, but not in a way that keeps you up at night. you have a confident, informed understanding of what other players can do, and you spend most of your time in "competitive" headspace thinking about articulating your differentiation. Because you're out in front building your own thing, people copy __you__ more than the other way around. But you do maintain just enough useful paranoia not to get overconfident.
