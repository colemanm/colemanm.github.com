In our [last issue](https://resextensa.substack.com/p/res-extensa-3-strategy-for-startups "Res Extensa #3: Strategy for Startups"), we'd weathered TS Zeta in the hills of Georgia, and the dissonance of being a lifelong Floridian sitting through gale-force winds in a mountain cabin. Last week a different category of storm hit us nationwide in the form of election week (which it seems we've mostly recovered from). Now as I write this one, Eta is [barreling toward us](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2020-11-11-tropical-storm-eta-forecast-florida-hurricane-watch "Tropical Storm Eta") after several days of expert projections that it'd miss by a wide margin. We're dealing with last-minute school closures and hopefully dodging major power outages. 2020 continues to deliver the goods.

There's a lot in store for this week, so let's get into it:

### Seeing Like a State

I've been deep in James C. Scott's _[Seeing Like a State](/books/scott-seeing-like-a-state/ "Seeing Like a State")_ lately, so I wanted to riff this week on Scott's notion of "**legibility**," the book's central idea. His thesis in _SLAS_ is that central authorities impose top-down, mandated designs on societies in order to make them easier to understand through simplification and optimization techniques. Examples in the book range from scientific forestry and naming traditions to urban planning and collectivist agriculture.

Scott calls this ideology "authoritarian [high modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_modernism)," wherein governments, driven by a zealous belief in knowledge and scientific expertise, determine they can restructure the social order for particular gain: higher crop yields, more compliant citizenry, more efficient cities, or crime-free neighborhoods (a dangerous proposition when a "crime" is redefined at will by authorities). He's ruthlessly critical of these ideas, as evidenced by the book's subtitle, and presents dozens of cases of top-down-design-gone-wrong, the most extreme case being the Soviet Union's collectivization program that led to [widespread famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932-33).

An interesting factor to think about is how and when to apply intentional design in service of legibility and control. It's not an all good–all bad proposition, to be sure. Even though Scott levels a pretty harsh review of high modernist ideology, even he acknowledges its value in small, targeted doses for specific problems. 

### Legibility: A Big Little Idea

I linked to a piece a while back [by Venkatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/), the source where I first learned of Scott's work.

The post is largely an introduction to the book's themes, but adds a few interesting notes on the psychology behind legibility. Given all the history we have that demonstrates the failure rate of high modernist thinking, why do we keep doing it?

> In _Mind Wide Open_, Steven Johnson’s entertaining story of his experiences subjecting himself to all sorts of medical scanning technologies, he describes his experience with getting an fMRI scan. Johnson tells the researcher that perhaps they should start by examining his brain’s baseline reaction to meaningless stimuli. He naively suggests a white-noise pattern as the right starter image. The researcher patiently informs him that subjects’ brains tend to go crazy when a white noise (high Shannon entropy) pattern is presented. The brain goes nuts trying to find order in the chaos. Instead, the researcher says, they usually start with something like a black-and-white checkerboard pattern.

Scott also points out in the book how much of the high modernist mission is driven by "from above" aesthetics, not on-the-ground results. He analyzes the work of [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier "Le Corbusier") and his visionary model for futuristic urban planning, most evident in his designs for Chandigurh in India and the manufactured Brazilian capital of Brasília (designed by his student, [Lúcio Costa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BAcio_Costa "Lucio Costa")).

While Brasília projects a degree of majesty from above, life on the street is a hollowed-out, sterile existence. Its design ignored the realities of how humans interact. Life is more complex than the few variables a planner can optimize for. It's telling that both Chandigurh and Brasília have lively slums on their outskirts, unplanned neighborhoods that filled demands unmet by the architected city centers.

He juxtaposes the work of Le Corbusier with that of [[Jane Jacobs]], grassroots city activist and author of [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]. Jacobs was a lifelong advocate of "street life," placing high emphasis on the organic, local, and human-scale factors that truly make spaces livable and enjoyable. She famously countered the ultimate high modernist visions of New York City planner Robert Moses.

This contrast between _failure_ in legible, designed systems and _resilience_ in emergent, organic ones triggers all of my free-market priors. The truth is there _is_ no "best" mental model here. Certain types of problems lend themselves well to top-down control (_require it_, in fact), and others produce the best results when markets and individuals are permitted to drive their own solutions. Standard timekeeping, transportation networks, space exploration, flood control — these are all challenges that are hard to address for a variety of reasons without centralized coordination.

Imposing legibility demands an appreciation of trade-offs. Yes, dictated addressing schemes and fixed property ownership documentation __do__ enable state control in the form of taxation, conscription, or surveillance. But in exchange for the __right__ degree of imposed structure, we get the benefit of property rights and land tenure.
