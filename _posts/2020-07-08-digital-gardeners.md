The "digital garden" concept is gaining in popularity. I've seen a dozen of them recently, with groups like the Roam community taking to publishing their own open notebooks.

[Maggie Appleton](https://twitter.com/Mappletons "Maggie Appleton on Twitter") (an awesome, prolific member of the [#roamcult](https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult "#roamcult")) created this small library of resources for creating your own garden, along with several examples of others in the community. I still have the [idea in my backlog](/post/a-system-for-publishing-evergreen-notes/ "A System for Publishing Evergreen Notes") of side projects to look at spinning up an open notebook like this.

Here's [Maggie's illustration](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1279798483218767877 "Illustration of digital gardens") of where the digital garden sits on the spectrum of content. All of her illustrations are excellent.
