I had a great, basic Father's Day here at the house. Colette made breakfast and the kids made me some cards:

I got the [chalkboard](/post/outdoor-chalkboard/ "Outdoor Chalkboard") finished up and ready to hang tomorrow. We spent most of the day out in the backyard with pool, slide, and playing in the grass. An excellent day!
