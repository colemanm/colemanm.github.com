I'm sure there are many like me who seek out ambient music for headphones-on, work-from-home listening. My preferences shift from soundtracks like [Blade Runner](/post/best-songs-pt-4-blade-runner-blues/ "Best Songs: Blade Runner Blues"), [electronic drone stuff](/post/musicforprogramming/ "musicForProgramming"), or ["focus" music](/post/aerial-video-for-geography-nerds/ "Aerial Video for Geography Nerds") like you can find on countless YouTube channels.

This list has all the great ambient works across genres; tons here that are new to me.

Personal favorites from the list:

* Brian Eno's _[Music for Airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_1:_Music_for_Airports "Music for Airports")_ (#1 of course)
* Oneohtrix Point Never (my favorite is the 3-hour _[Rifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifts_(album) "Rifts")_ compilation)
* Eno's _[Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo:_Atmospheres_and_Soundtracks "Apollo")_
* Fennesz's _[Endless Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_Summer_(Fennesz_album) "Endless Summer")_
