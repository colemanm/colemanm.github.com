One of my favorite games hit its 20th birthday. Two decades ago _Deus Ex_ was an amazing achievement in open narrative, emergent game design.

In this piece, Rock Paper Shotgun gathered up a bunch of the original team from John Romeroâ€™s [Ion Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Storm "Ion Storm") studio to look back on the process of creating the game:

> Harvey Smith (lead designer): We were very influenced by three games: _Thief_, _System Shock 2_ and _Half-Life_. There was a lot of discussion around whether it was more elegant to get through a level without being spotted and killing everybody. But there was also political discussion about whether there was inherent bias in a game that gives you a mission to kill a bunch of enemies without questioning it. And of course, there is.
