Matthew Ball dives into Nintendo's potential and what differentiates its culture from the rest of its media and gaming comparisons, like Disney.

The section on their mobile performance is particularly shocking. I knew Nintendo hadn't been that engaged in trying to compete in mobile gaming (meaning iOS and Android), but it's been a lot worse than I thought. Seems like it would be a dead-on win for them.

> Obviously, Nintendoâ€™s share of the economics declines across each group. This, itself, is not a problem. Whatâ€™s a problem is that the greater Nintendoâ€™s involvement, the less successful a mobile title seems to be. Nintendoâ€™s mobile creative seems to erode the success of a title more than its IP lifts it. Put another way, Nintendoâ€™s involvement increases margins but decreases revenue by an even greater degree.
