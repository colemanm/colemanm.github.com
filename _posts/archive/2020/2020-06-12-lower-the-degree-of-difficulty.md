Fred Wilson with advice to startups on keeping things simple:

> I have sat through numerous pitches where I am listening to the founder explain their technology and go to market plan and I think “this is going to be a reverse triple somersault with two twists in pike and there is no way they are going to land it...
>
> So the better approach is to pick something simple to execute, nail it, then build on it with another relatively simple move, nail that too, and keep going.

One of the benefits of staying in bootstrapped mode is that this is forced on you; if you make projects or goals too big, you waste time and money and don't hit the target. There's a temptation to overcomplicate goals or to try and build something too complex because it _feels_ like it's more valuable. If you index on the wrong things, you can get yourself convinced that the number of features tracks with value, when we all know that's dangerous territory to tread, especially for small teams.
