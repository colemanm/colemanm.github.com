In high school I was pretty big into PC gaming. Games like _[Ultima VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VII:_The_Black_Gate "Ultima VII")_, _[Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(1993_video_game) "Syndicate")_, _[Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(video_game) "Fallout")_, _[Total Annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation "Total Annihilation")_, and _[Crusader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader:_No_Remorse "Crusader")_ were in heavy rotation for years. Sid Meier's _[Civilization II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_II "Civilization II")_ was particularly formative for me at the time it was released, and I'd credit with a lot of my early interest in world history.

I'm adding to my reading list Meier's new memoir, appropriately titled _[Memoir! A Life in Computer Games](https://amzn.to/3mluuMs "Sid Meier's Memoir!")_.
