An interesting detailed analysis on SpaceXâ€™s Starlink project, which intends to put tens of thousands of microsatellites in orbit to provide a blanket of global internet connectivity.

> Starlinkâ€™s world-spanning internet will bring high quality internet access to every corner of the globe. For the first time, internet availability will depend not on how close a particular country or city comes to a strategic fiber route, but on whether it can view the sky. Entrepreneurs the world over will have unfettered access to the global internet irrespective of their own variously incompetent and/or corrupt government telco monopolies. Starlinkâ€™s monopoly-breaking capacity will catalyze enormous positive change, bringing, for the first time, billions of humans into our future global cybernetic collective.
