Erik Torenberg, in his latest newsletter:

> Should you specialize or generalize? Either could work, but you have to actually be good at something. That’s a key concept. If you’re a generalist, you want to be the best at the intersection of a few different skills, even if it’s a few disparate things. The challenge is it's easy to lie to yourself & say that you're a generalist when in reality you've tried a bunch of things and you've flaked out when things got hard and then tried something else. You want to be at least great at one thing, and then apply that lens or skill to other categories.

As a natural generalist with super wide interests, I think about this problem. Is that a good thing? Should I focus more?

After reading David Epstein's _[Range](/books/epstein-range/ "Range")_ last year, I feel that one isn't more correct than the other, just depends on where you're applying talents.
