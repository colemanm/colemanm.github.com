[Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game) "Deus Ex") is still one of my favorite games of all time. First played dozens of times when first released, and every few years I still break it back out to stroll through the dystopian visions of Hell's Kitchen, Hong Kong, and Liberty Island.

Probably a decade ago or more I found the [original ambient synth soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yDVM77lGlM) mp3s and still give it a listen once in a while, which sends me straight back to 20 years ago, sitting at the PC at 2am.

The composer of the original soundtrack, Alex Brandon, just recently produced a remix album called [Conspiravision](https://alexanderbrandon.bandcamp.com/album/conspiravision-deus-ex-remixed), with most of the tracks revamped. You can even get it on vinyl in August[^vinyl].

That 10 minute long [UNATCO theme](https://alexanderbrandon.bandcamp.com/track/home-base-unatco) really brings back the memories.

[^vinyl]: Man, a world where you can get a 20 year old video game soundtrack re-release on vinyl is weird and fantastic.
