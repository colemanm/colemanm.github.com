This is an oral history of the famous [Mother of All Demos](/post/the-mother-of-all-demos/ "The Mother of All Demos"), wherein Doug Engelbart unveiled a half-dozen technologies including the mouse, screencasting, the [NLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system) "NLS"), hypertext, windowing, and more. It's an excerpt from Adam Fisher's [Valley of Genius](https://amzn.to/3gCPwCT "Valley of Genius").

> **Bob Taylor:**Â "The mouse was created by NASA funding. Remember when NASA was advertising Tang as its big contribution to the civilized world? Well, there was a better example, but they didnâ€™t know about it."
