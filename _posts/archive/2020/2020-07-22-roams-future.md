[Roam Research](/post/getting-comfortable-with-roam/ "Getting Comfortable with  Roam") already has a deep community of users coalescing around it, building [extensions](/post/roam-tools/ "Roam Tools"), custom styles, and poking at the edges of how it could be extended.
In this post, [David Crandall](https://twitter.com/davidcrandall_w "David Crandall on Twitter") outlines some possibilities of what could be in Roam's future, breaking it out into various ideas at the presentation, service, and database layers. His diagram does a great job articulating what else could be possible with an open Roam API.

Especially interesting to me:

* Abilities to selectively expose pages from a graph to the public, for cross-linking to from others' Roam graphs
* Linking to blocks in public graphs (like literary works on [RoamPublic](https://www.roampublic.com/directory/ "Roam Public"))
* Integrations with apps like David mentions â€” [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/ "Drafts"), Zapier, Shortcuts
