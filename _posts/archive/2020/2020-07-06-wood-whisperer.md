I’m a sucker for YouTube content of makers and craftsmen at work. I’ve posted before about channels like [Black Beard Projects](/post/checking-in-on-tool-restoration-youtube/ "Checking on Tool Restoration YouTube") restoring old shop tools, and recently Kenji Lopez-Alt’s [first-person cooking show](/post/kenjis-first-person-cooking/ "Kenji's First-Person Cooking"). 

I grew up doing watching my grandfather’s carpentry in his wood shop, and did many projects over the years tinkering around with my dad and brothers at home. It’s been something I’ve always had ideas about doing again, whenever I can create the space for small projects.

But during quarantine times, Marc Spagnuolo’s Wood Whisperer channel is a great option to watch someone at work on impressive projects.
