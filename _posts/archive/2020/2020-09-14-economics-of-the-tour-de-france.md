The Tour is on its second rest day, 15 stages into a brutal 3 weeks of hills, mountains, and even challenging "easy days."

I've followed the sport pretty closely over the past 6 years, but not too far into the business behind it. This article goes deep into the economics of the race. The organizer, [ASO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Sport_Organisation "ASO"), doesn't disclose financial numbers, so this was an interesting look at some estimates of the money generated by the race. Also some good insight into how team budgets and sponsorships work.
