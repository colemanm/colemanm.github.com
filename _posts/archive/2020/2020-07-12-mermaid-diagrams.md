[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid "Mermaid") is a neat project to add a custom syntax layer in Markdown to support rendering diagrams like flowcharts and sequences.

Roam just recently [added support for Mermaid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF22iK8fX-A "Mermaid diagrams in Roam") in Roam graphs, which renders your diagram live as you edit the markup in a page. This is useful for adding visuals to pages, but I'll have to mess around and learn its syntax to get comfortable.
