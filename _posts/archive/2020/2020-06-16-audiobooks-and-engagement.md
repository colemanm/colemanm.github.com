Recently Nat Eliason started a thread on the subject of audiobooks, and how much lower comprehension and retention is when listening versus reading:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kinda like how it&#39;s hard to go back to reading after watching more TV.<br><br>Audiobooks don&#39;t count as reading. <a href="https://t.co/QeZqB8xFTb">https://t.co/QeZqB8xFTb</a></p>&mdash; Nat Eliason (@nateliason) <a href="https://twitter.com/nateliason/status/1265374116540043270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I know where he's coming from here. I probably consume half my books in audio form, and on certain dimensions here I would agree. My general pattern is very selective in what I'll choose to listen to instead of read in text. Fiction is typically pretty safe, and with non-fiction I tend to make a judgement call on how much I'll want to take notes, highlights, or generally move more slowly through the ideas. For example, right now I'm reading both _[From Dawn to Decadence](/books/barzun-from-dawn-to-decadence/ "From Dawn to Decadence")_ and _[The Open Society and its Enemies](/books/popper-the-open-society-and-its-enemies/ "The Open Society and its Enemies")_, two books that are not only in the 800+ page range, but also are full of rich references and other things that make me want to take my time with them.

Often even after listening to a book, if it's particularly thought-provoking I have no problem also buying a Kindle version to flip through and annotate after listening sessions. I've done this probably 10 or 12 times and it works fine for me. I think everyone would agree that re-reads are much more fruitful for deep comprehension, and doing it this way with audio-then-text is sort of like having a primer on the material that makes the text reading far more productive.

I would also add that audiobook listening itself is a _skill_. When I first started listening to books, it took me a while to get comfortable with the activity. I'd listen to fiction and totally lose the plot after a few minutes, unable to follow along with what was happening. Now that I listen to audio routinely, along with thousands of hours of podcasts, I believe my auditory comprehension rate is _much_ higher than it was, say, 10 or 15 years ago.

So I think if you combine treating it like a skill you can improve with time, being selective about what you choose to consume through audio, and augmenting listening with text for certain engaging books, audiobooks can be a high-signal new channel for knowledge.
