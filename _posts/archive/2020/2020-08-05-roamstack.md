The [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/ "Roam Research") ecosystem is rapidly expanding these days. It's on its way to becoming platform beyond personal knowledge management — an operating system for ideas, thinking, knowledge synthesis, and writing.

[Ramses Oudt](https://twitter.com/rroudt "Ramses Oudt") and [Francis Miller](https://twitter.com/francis_miller "Francis Miller") (creator of [RoamBrain](https://www.roambrain.com/ "RoamBrain")) put together a new learning newsletter with lessons on how to get the most out of Roam and its surrounding orbit of tools and add-ons.
