Colette bought an inflatable stand-up paddleboard to use on our beach vacation this week. Neither of us had ever tried one before, but you see them all over the place along the St. Pete shoreline.

As an observer, it certainly looks like a workout with having to stand the whole time. But after using one it turns out that’s an understatement. The lower leg, foot, and ankle workout you get is impressive. I’m sure doing it in the open water of the Gulf makes it more challenging with the chop and swell, but even in the relatively calm morning water it’s still tiring.

It’s a fun workout, though. I’m sure doing it in the canals of the neighborhood or the bay would be a bit more relaxing. Could add another exercise activity to the rotation.
