### 🛠 [Attitudes, Aptitudes, and Progress](https://youtu.be/tsILktLGnj0 "Attitudes, Aptitudes, and Progress")

Joel Mokyr’s talk on the most recent session of _[The Torch of Progress](https://progressstudies.school/category/the-torch-of-progress/ "The Torch of Progress")_ series.

### 🧠 [How to Be a Neo-Cartesian Cyborg](https://youtu.be/yOGi9RfC3Eg "How to Be a Neo-Cartesian Cyborg")

A recent talk from Maggie Appleton on the "building a second brain" concept.

### 👋🏼 [Take a Tour of HEY](https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI "Take a Tour of HEY")

Great example of how to do a product demo. Informal style, clearly prepared but not "scripted," and deep care and attention to the product.
