You don't have to be an avid cycling fan to be mpressed with Tadej Pogačar's incredible time trial on stage 20 of this year's Tour de France. He bested the 2nd and 3rd place riders by a full minute, 1:21 better than 150 other riders. Absolutely unbelievable.

His countryman Primož Roglič (a heavy favorite for the overall weeks before the Tour) had nearly a minute on him in the yellow jersey, going into a long TT ending with a climbing finish on La Planche de Belles Filles.

I just wonder how much different the Tour results would look if this TT was stage 3 instead of 20.
