A quick touch on progress for July. I can't believe it's already been 5 months since the beginning of the pandemic.

| Activity       | Progress      | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 371.27 miles  | 379 miles    | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-8.05</span>   |
| **Meditation** | 1070 minutes  | 1821 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="">â€”</span>          |
| **Reading**    | 17 books      | 17.51 books  | 30 books     | <span class="red">-0.51</span>   |

Nothing that notable this month. Steady upkeep on the running goals, but the summer time in Florida is brutal. Really restricts the scheduling if you can't do early morning or late evening exercise.

I've got a couple of side projects going on that I've been pleased with the progress on: a couple of things with the website and some work on personal finances that all feel like good progress.
