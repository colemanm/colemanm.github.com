I just finished publishing my summary and takeaways from Marty Cagan's _[Inspired](/books/cagan-inspired/ "Inspired by Marty Cagan")_, his collection of ideas on building product teams. A lot of solid fundamentals there for startups, more meat on the bone in this one than most business books of its ilk.

I'm gradually working back through book highlights and building out literature notes, which I'd also one day like to get published in full somehow. I'm thinking about how I can do that while preserving some of the interlinking in my Roam graph, and publishing some of those evergreen notes, as well.
