With this year's Tour de France delayed (as of now, til late August), the guys from The Move have been going over some of the best stages from the US Postal years. It's a cool format, sort of like a commentary track over the exciting parts of the climbs and pursuits.

I especially enjoy the commentary from Johan Bruyneel, who was the team director at the time. The insider commentary on strategy is neat — hard to appreciate as a TV viewer of cycling.
