### ðŸ”— [A Clean Start for the Web](https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html "A Clean Start for the Web")

[Tom MacWright](https://twitter.com/tmcw) with some ideas for cleaning up ever-creeping morass of web technology:

> I think this combination would bring speed back, in a huge way. You could get a page on the screen in a fraction of the time of the web. The memory consumption could be tiny. It would be incredibly accessible, by default. You could make great-looking default stylesheets and share alternative user stylesheets. With dramatically limited scope, you could port it to all kinds of devices.

> And, maybe most importantly, what would website editing tools look like? They could beÂ _way_Â simpler.

Great discussion on this episode of EconTalk with [Michael Munger](https://twitter.com/mungowitz) about the possibilities post-COVID of "unbundling" the university a decentralized set of separate services that could combine to give serve the same needs that traditional universities do.

I saw this through a tweet somewhere, but what a great work of design. Very George Jetson.
