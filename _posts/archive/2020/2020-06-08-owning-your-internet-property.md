Ben Thompson posted this a few days ago, something I’m glad to see getting so many likes and retweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blogs = still the best representation of the Internet’s promise. Everyone should have a site that they own, not just a social media account (which are great for promoting blog posts).</p>&mdash; Ben Thompson (@benthompson) <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1269631831617318913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Even as it’s gotten so easy to publish your own content with Wordpress, Substack, Ghost, and even GitHub Pages, we live in a time when personal property on the open web is in decline. The volumes of users and content living in closed ecosystems like Twitter or Facebook are booming, while the number of blogs aren’t. I agree with Ben, tools like Twitter are _additive_ to the foundation of owning your own space. They’re not replacements, and absolutely bring value in accessing the network effects for distribution.
