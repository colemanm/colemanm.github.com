Today we did a morning out with the kids down at The Pier.

The splash pad and playground they have down there are really top-notch, even though the playground is still mostly a bit out of range for Everett to do on his own. The whole area has been a great addition to the cityscape of downtown St. Pete, though. I've been doing runs down there a lot lately at night, a great extension of the run and turnaround point for my route.
