This was a livestream from a while back with Maggie Appleton (her work referenced in this past [Weekend Reading](/post/weekend-reading-timeful-texts-sumo-startups-and-canva-backlinks/ "Weekend Reading: Timeful Texts, Sumo Startups, and Canva Backlinks")) going step by step through her illustration process.

She uses a few straightforward but useful techniques, an iPad, ProCreate, and iteration to make some really [great creations](https://maggieappleton.com/illustration "Maggie Appleton's Illustrations").
