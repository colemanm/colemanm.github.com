This is the second episode of the "Torch of Progress" series that the [Progress Studies for Young Scholars](/post/progress-studies-for-young-scholars/ "Progress Studies for Young Scholars") program is putting on, hosted by [Jason Crawford](https://www.jasoncrawford.org "Jason Crawford"). Tyler Cowen is unbelievably prolific in projects he's got going on, so it's great to see him making the time for things like this.
