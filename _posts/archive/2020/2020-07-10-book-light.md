I do most of my nighttime reading with my [Kindle](/post/kindle/ "Kindle"), but lately I've been reading a couple of books that don't exist in ebook format. I actually do prefer reading paper books as an experience, but I still favor the ebooks especially for [highlighting](/post/readwise/ "Readwise"), but also for the obvious benefits of portability and availability.

Most of the clip-on book lights out there are clunky and annoying. Years ago I had something called a [LightWedge](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972970169/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=colemanmorg-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0972970169&linkId=e0042c1943e33eb30c186e52fe29fe73 "LightWedge") that was pretty clever, but too expensive, fragile, and heavy for regular use.

I went out looking for a simple, affordable option that also had no blue light, since that can interfere with sleep quality. I found [this option from Hooga](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YQ86S1Z/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=colemanmorg-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07YQ86S1Z&linkId=1e0a59743f9659d8b78f861532d2861a "Hooga Book Light") that's quite nice so far:

It's a flexible, low-profile LED light that only has a single amber colored option (which is great). It charges via USB, and also flattens down nicely to fit in a bag when mobile or traveling. The clip on it works well. I just clamp it on to the back bunch of pages so it doesn't interfere with page-turning. It stays out of the way but has a firm enough clip strength to stay on just fine.

Highly recommended so far. I've used it for several hours with no charging yet. Just what I wanted. For $10 it's hard to beat.
