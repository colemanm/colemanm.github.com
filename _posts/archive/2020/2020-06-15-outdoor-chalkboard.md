Colette had this idea to build an outdoor chalkboard for the kids to use, hung on the fence. I went yesterday and bought some materials to put one together. I also found out in drawing up the plan that chalkboard paint exists, which is amazing. I'm not sure how exactly it works, but I bought some and we'll find out.

It only requires some basic ingredients:

* Cement backerboard (like you use for moisture-resistant surfaces)
* 1x4 boards for frame
* Adhesive
* Lag screws for hanging

We'll see how it works out. Should be pretty easy, and I know the kid will enjoy it!
