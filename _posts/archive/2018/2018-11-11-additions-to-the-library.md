As always during trips to Jacksonville, I made a visit to [Chamblin Bookmine](http://chamblinbookmine.com/default.aspx "Chamblin Bookmine"), my favorite bookstore. I never have enough time to browse, this time had about an hour before I had to be somewhere. So I had to act fast and hit all the sections looking for my target buys.

* Thomas Sowell – _[A Conflict of Visions](/books/sowell-a-conflict-of-visions/ "Conflict of Visions")_
* John Locke – _[Two Treatises of Government](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/364550 "Two Treatises of Government")_
* Will Durant – _[The Story of Philosophy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31795 "The Story of Philosophy")_
* Milton Friedman – _[Free to Choose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97820 "Free to Choose")_
* F.A. Hayek – _[The Road to Serfdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299215 "The Road to Serfdom")_

A few of these I've read (Sowell and Effinger’s _Budayeen_ trilogy), but wanted to add them to the library for future re-reads.
