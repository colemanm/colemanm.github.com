I normally avoid early upgrades to iOS betas, having been burned too many times in the past. But this time, the release of iPadOS is too exciting for me to avoid. Now that the public beta is available, I set it up and am already enjoying the changes. So far, the home screen app density and Today view up front is already a huge improvement for using the iPad for productivity, as expected. The Share Sheet changes are also pretty slick. Once I spend more time with it I’ll probably post some more thoughts, but it’s looking good for further enabling those of us interested in getting work done on iPad.
