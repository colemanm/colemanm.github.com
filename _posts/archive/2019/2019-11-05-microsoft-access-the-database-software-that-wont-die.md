I love this story about Access and how it's still hanging on with a sizable user base after almost a decade of neglect by its parent. It goes to show you that there are still gaps in the market for software being filled by 10 year-stale applications. Getting users to unlearn behaviors is much harder than giving them an Airtable, Webflow, or Fulcrum â€” too much comfort and muscle memory to overcome.

Its long lifespan can be attributed to how it services the power user, as well as how simple it is to create a relational database with so few steps ("it just works"):

> Power users can be a dangerous group to help. With a little knowledge, you can make a very powerful weapon for shooting yourself in the foot. But there is a serious untapped potential here. Give a technical person a way to solve their problems that doesnâ€™t involve writing pages of code, and they can make a difference â€” automating small tasks, managing their own islands of data, and helping to keep their local environment organized and effective.

> Today, there remains a hunger for codeless or code-light tools. Motivated people want to do their jobs without paying expensive professionals for every semicolon. But so far the only offerings weâ€™ve given them are a VBA macro language from a generation ago and pricey tools like PowerApps that only work if your business signs up for a stack of Microsoft cloud products.

The low/no-code universe of applications is expanding in the last couple years. We're [riding this wave ourselves](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/ "Fulcrum") and have been betting on it since 2011. In the market for data tools, there's a spectrum of user capability: from the totally non-technical on one end (Excel might be a stretch for these folks) to the developer user on the other (where's my SQL Server?). What stories like this demonstrate is that that "power user" middle is a _lot_ wider than most of us have predicted.
