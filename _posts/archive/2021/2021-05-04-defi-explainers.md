I've gone over off the deep end the last couple weeks trying to wrap my head around DeFi. To date I've only dabbled in crypto, being lucky enough to ride some small waves, though nothing life-changing.

DeFi (decentralized finance) is fascinating for its disruption potential (and Ethereum platform on which it's all built). A basic understanding of the conceptual possibilities shows this stuff is here to stay, even if not in the same form or as loud as meme-ish as it's been over the past year.

Through Twitter I discovered a channel called Finematics that has a ton of great explainer videos walking through topics like smart contracts, the history of DeFi, NFTs, yield farming, and dozens of others on the esoteric crypto world.
