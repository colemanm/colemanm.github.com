Byrne Hobart [makes the case](https://diff.substack.com/p/three-bull-cases-for-starlink "Three Bull Cases for Starlink") for Starlink's business model:

> The line between a vision and a sales pitch is always blurry, and Elon Musk is unusually good at using this to his advantage. There's a reasonable case that Starlink is just a natural way to amortize the fixed cost of SpaceX's investment in launch infrastructure. But a sufficiently compelling sales pitch has a way of coming true, and if part of the pitch of Starlink is that it's a censorship-resistant communications medium that creates access to the global Internet, not individual countries' more restricted versions of it, then that may be what it becomes.

I set an alert on the SpaceX YouTube channel a few months ago, which gives me a closer perspective on how much they're investing in Starlink, their satellite internet constellation. Multiple times a month I get a notice of a live-streamed Falcon launch with a flock of new Starlink sensors being put into orbit.

Each of these payloads puts 60 new birds into space. Now Starlink is in beta with early customers, and I've seen some [amazing posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/lp3tkb/i_cannot_believe_this_is_a_reality_internet_at/ "Internet it in the mountains") from folks at their off-grid cabins, now with 300down/20up connections where they used to be dozens of miles from connectivity of any form.
