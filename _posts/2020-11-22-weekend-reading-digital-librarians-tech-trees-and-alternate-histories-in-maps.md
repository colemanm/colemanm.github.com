### 📑 [Chief Notion Officer](https://julian.digital/2020/11/20/chief-notion-officer/ "Chief Notion Officer")

Julian Lehr is onto something here. All modern organizations are plagued with a problem of managing internal documentations. We have ample tools and keep squishing the problem from one place to another: wikis, search, tasks — it's a game of whack-a-mole to find the right version of a document. He ponders at what size it makes sense to invest in a "digital librarian":

> A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees??

### 🌳 [The Tree of Up](https://up.com.au/tree/ "The Tree of Up")

Up created a tech tree representation of their product and roadmap. Genius.

Speculative maps of alternate historical timelines.
