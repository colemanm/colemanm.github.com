Here's [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey "Rich Hickey") (creator of Clojure), on the benefits of stepping away from the computer, in his talk on "hammock-driven development":

Every time I'm working on something new, I'm stunned how challenging I find it to get "unstuck" while sitting at my desk. Some days I can get in the zone, but most of the time the zone eludes me. It's not even the active distractions of Slacks, meetings, and email, though those are never-ending, but temptation from the no-kidding _thousands_ of individual little shiny objects to get spun up by.

But then when I'm out for a walk, a run, or driving somewhere, thoughts and ideas abound. And of course I'm never in a good position to take notes or jump right into writing or doing anything about them at the time. My post from last year on [Downtime Thinking](/post/downtime-thinking/ "Downtime Thinking") looked at my experience with this phenomenon.

Hammock-driven creativity helps the mind jar loose from its normal working context. Environment is a [strong contributor to](/post/two-years-of-everyday-writing/ "Two Years of Everyday Writing") controlling your behavior. For myself, my "normal" work environment — sitting at my desk, keyboard and mouse in hand, multiple monitors available — is associated in my brain with dozens of activities _other than_ creative or critical thinking. I've experimented lately with "morning pages" as a mechanism working on the writing habit. Start a timer and do nothing but write free-form for 25 minutes. I'm having mixed success with it many times, but occasional sessions lead to solid ideas, where I'll blow past the timer.

If I can combine the intentionality of morning pages with a minor change of scenery, the forces could combine into a productive combo.

In a [recent interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/arts/television/jerry-seinfeld-netflix.html "Jerry Seinfeld Interview"), Jerry Seinfeld described his writing sessions, a brilliantly simple practice:

> I still have a writing session every day. It’s another thing that organizes your mind. The coffee goes here. The pad goes here. The notes go here. My writing technique is just: You can’t do anything else. You don’t have to write, but you can’t do anything else. The writing is such an ordeal.

I love that: **"You can't do anything else. You don't have to write, but you can't do anything else."**

Setting the table for the writing session triggers the Pavlovian mode: "this is writing time." Then you've got the intention, that you _can't do anything else_. And I love how he gives himself the leeway to not even write! But in exchange for the freedom for work-avoidance, your only other option is staring at the wall.
