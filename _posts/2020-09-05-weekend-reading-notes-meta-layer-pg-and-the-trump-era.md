### 🏛 [The Trump Era Sucks and Needs to Be Over](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-trump-era-sucks-and-needs-to "The Trump Era Sucks and Needs to Be Over")

Matt Taibbi is always good for cutting to the chase.

> Donald Trump is so unlike most people, and so especially unlike anyone raised under a conventional moral framework, that he’s perpetually misdiagnosed. The words we see slapped on him most often, like “fascist” and “authoritarian,” nowhere near describe what he really is, and I don’t mean that as a compliment. It’s been proven across four years that Trump lacks the attention span or ambition required to implement a true dictatorial regime. He might not have a moral problem with the idea, but two minutes into the plan he’d leave the room, phone in hand, to throw on a robe and watch himself on _Fox and Friends_ over a cheeseburger.
