This is one of the best descriptions I've seen for why Roam is different than the peers it's often compared to:

> Today Roam is a powerful single-player tool that you can think of as a functional reactive coding environment for remixing your own thoughts. Use cases extend from grocery lists all the way to conceptual SQL scripts for your ideas.
>
> Co-founder Conor White-Sullivan has compared Roam to Excel as both are products with ‚Äúa low floor and a high ceiling.‚Äù You don‚Äôt have to start using Excel by using pivot tables. It‚Äôs the same product no matter how advanced you are as a user. But, like with Excel, you get more power out of Roam as you get better at using it.

With the Roam team currently hard at work on [an open API layer](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1307107745397604354 "Roam API announcement"), it's going to be wild to see the diversity of tools people build on top of it.
