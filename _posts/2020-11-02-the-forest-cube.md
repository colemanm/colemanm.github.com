There's a YouTube channel I linked a couple months back called "Modern Self Reliance" where a group of guys [built an off-grid cabin](/post/off-grid-cabin/).
In a new series, they're adding a neighboring cabin in the form of an 8'x8'x8' cube, for others to hang out on the property.
It's an excellent series so far. I love how they harvest materials from the property itself (like the cabin's cedar posts) or salvage things from past projects to do the builds. Looks like a ton of fun.
