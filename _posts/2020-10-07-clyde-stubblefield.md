A Slack chat this morning led to a discussion of _[Funky Drummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Drummer "Funky Drummer")_ and how often its been sampled. I ran across this good clip of the player himself, drummer [Clyde Stubblefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Stubblefield "Clyde Stubblefield"), who played with James Brown's band during the late-60s. He _improvised_ the famous break that's been used in dozens of popular tracks in hip-hop history.
