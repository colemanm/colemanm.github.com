These updates during the quarantine are weird. In some ways time feels like it's standing still, in others it feels like it's flying by. Every day feels mostly the same. Even though some has opened up in our area, we're still basically in isolation from friends.

| Activity       | Progress      | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 317.49 miles  | 324 miles    | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-6.62</span>   |
| **Meditation** | 1070 minutes  | 1556 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="">â€”</span>          |
| **Reading**    | 15 books      | 14.96 books  | 30 books     | <span class="green">+0.04</span> |

It wasn't that interesting of a month from a goals perspective. I'm continuing to close the mileage gap that I fell into early in the year. I'm hoping in July to bring that one into the green. Other than that, nothing notable this month other than powering on through this quarantine. Seems like it's going to last a while longer now.
