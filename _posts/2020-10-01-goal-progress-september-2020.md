For the month of September:

| Activity       | Progress      | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 484.26 miles  | 488 miles    | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-3.69</span>   |
| **Meditation** | 1070 minutes  | 2342 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="">â€”</span>          |
| **Reading**    | 19 books      | 22.52 books  | 30 books     | <span class="red">-2.52</span>   |

Good news is I closed the deficit a bit on the running goal, even though it didn't feel like a particularly productive month there.

COVID makes time fly and crawl simultaneously, through some sort of perverse time distortion. There were just no notable events this month to break up the monotony of online school, Zoom meetings, and tame weekends around the house. Maybe the holidays and better weather we're entering soon will help get us outside some more.
