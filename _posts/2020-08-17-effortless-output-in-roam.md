Today Nat Eliason launched [version 2](https://www.effortlessoutput.com/ "Effortless Output in Roam") of his Effortless Output course for learning Roam.

This time around he's doing an interesting thing with live courses and students selecting a capstone project. Adding something that goes beyond the typical online video self-paced learning style of most tutorials is fascinating.

> This is a course about creating something new, not just how to use Roam. Together we'll pick an area you're interested in to explore as you develop your skills with Roam, and a final product you want to create with your newfound abilities.

For advanced learning of any sort of craft (and I'd call quality note-taking a craft, for sure), hands-on learning is the only way to go. It's too easy to watch clips of someone else working, then get stuck with a "blank canvas" problem when you try to get started yourself.

Very interested to see how this works out! It could show some interesting results to help improve other online learning resources.
