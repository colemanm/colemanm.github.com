### 🏀 [What I Learned Inside the NBA Bubble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/magazine/nba-bubble.html "What I Learned Inside the NBA Bubble")

A good piece giving an inside look of what life is like for a journalist inside the bubble.

I've missed most of the playoffs this year during this strange time for sports. It's been impressive that the NBA could pull this off and still put together a compelling end to the season when everyone assumed that it'd be an asterisk-ridden result with players and teams lost to COVID. It's turned out to be incredibly well executed. The finals have nearly the same energy that I remember from recent seasons. As of writing, the Heat have pulled back to 2 games to 3 against the Lakers.

### 🌾 [Homesteading the Twittersphere](https://alexdanco.com/2020/08/21/homesteading-the-twittersphere/ "Homesteading the Twittersphere")

Alex Danco on scarcity and gift culture:

> Status is clearly scarce, and in a gift culture like the free software community – or on Finance Twitter – the way you earn status is by putting in real effort, and then giving away the fruits of that effort.
>
> Of course, the effort you put in has to actually be valuable, and recognized as such by your peer group. So the optimal thing for you to do, whether you’re an open source software developer or a Twitter armchair analyst, is to figure out your specialty zone that’s simultaneously useful, but unique – and then homestead it. Establish and cultivate it, like a garden or a plot of land, that you’re tending for the communal benefit of everyone. People come to associate that little plot of land with you specifically, and think of you whenever they go near it.

### 🏆 [The Difference Between Amateurs and Professionals](https://fs.blog/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/ "The Difference Between Amateurs and Professionals")

A solid list from Farnam Street:

> * Amateurs think they are good at everything. Professionals understand their circles of competence.
> * Amateurs see feedback and coaching as someone criticizing them as a person. Professionals know they have weak spots and seek out thoughtful criticism.
> * Amateurs focus on being right. Professionals focus on getting the best outcome.
> * Amateurs make decisions in committees so there is no one person responsible if things go wrong. Professionals make decisions as individuals and accept responsibility.
