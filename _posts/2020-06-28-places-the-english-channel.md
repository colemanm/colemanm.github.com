This [image from Landsat 8](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146897/channeling-a-bloom “Channeling a Bloom”) shows the western end of the English Channel off the coast of Cornwall. A phytoplankton bloom spreads for dozens of miles, filling the St. Austell Bay.

The only time I was on the Channel was on the ferry from Dover to Calais, on a particularly rough but clear day.
