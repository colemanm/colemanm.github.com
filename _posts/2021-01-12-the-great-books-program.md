As I was thinking about some reading/study goals for 2021, I wanted to commit myself to prioritizing more of the classics — notable works of philosophy, literature, and history that. I came across Twitter toward the end of the year, from Tommy Collison:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Plan: read 150 classic works in 5 years.<br><br>📚The list: <a href="https://t.co/Wk2ROPED7L">https://t.co/Wk2ROPED7L</a><br>📰Newsletter to follow along: <a href="https://t.co/hi03UrYmfb">https://t.co/hi03UrYmfb</a><br>🗣️Pre-registration for the <a href="https://twitter.com/interintellect_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@interintellect_</a> salons I&#39;m lucky enough to co-host with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmcdougall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dmcdougall</a>: <a href="https://t.co/n9q9xZRs9M">https://t.co/n9q9xZRs9M</a><a href="https://t.co/rtCUqUkYZ5">https://t.co/rtCUqUkYZ5</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Collison (@tommycollison) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommycollison/status/1334689781893087233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Looking at the full list, that's some serious commitment to get through it all each year. I'm not ready to go this deep, but I'm certainly interested in many of them.
