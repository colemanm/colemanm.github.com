Ben Thompson follows up his 2017 piece with an update on the state of bundling strategies from some of the big tech and media companies.

I liked this description of where Disney+ fits into Disney's overall strategy with the service:

> While Disneyâ€™s hand was certainly forced by the COVID pandemic, the companyâ€™s overall goal is to maximize revenue per customer via its highly differentiated IP; to that end, just as Disney+ is a way to connect with customers and lure them to Disney World or a Disney Cruise, it is equally effective at serving as a platform for shifting the theater window to customersâ€™ living rooms.
