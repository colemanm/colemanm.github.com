Next week us and the local family will be at Anna Maria Island for what is largely a "staycation" â€” a week at a beach house about 45 minutes from home.

We'll see how things work with trying to stay semi-quarantined while off-site away from home. The house we're staying in is right on the beach about 100 feet from the Gulf, with it's own section of private beach. If we're properly provisioned, we should be all set to have a relaxing time for the week[^kids]. The forecast looks good, all the kids are ready to go.

Only plans so far (if the kids allow): running, reading, kayaking, fishing, cooking.

[^kids]: At least as relaxed as you can get with 10 kids 10 and under tearing around the property.
