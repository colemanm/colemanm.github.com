I've finally joined the newsletter club! Today I sent out [the first issue](https://resextensa.substack.com/p/res-extensa-1-roam-and-readwise-the "Res Extensa Issue 1") of a new project, a bi-weekly email newsletter called **Res Extensa**.

My intent right now is for the newsletter to be a less-frequent companion to the blog, with some highlights of recent things I've been reading, writing, or interested in.

As I wrote in the email, I once had an RSS-to-email setup using Mailchimp, for folks who wanted to subscribe to the blog without RSS. It's a bit clunky, and since I started the daily blogging routine, an overload for inbox delivery.

The name comes from Descartes's concept of mind-body dualism, as half of a pair of substances: _res cogitans_ and _res extensa_ — translated roughly to "thinking substance" and "extended substance," respectively. I guess it's a fitting name; all of the things that extend from my thinking.

If you're interested in subscribing, [head over to the Substack](https://resextensa.substack.com/ "Res Extensa") and check it out!
