Reason Magazine has put together a 4-part documentary series on the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk "Cypherpunk") movement, the early-90s collective of hobbyist computer enthusiasts that believed in an open and free internet. Their philosophies influenced cryptography, bitcoin, and BitTorrent.
